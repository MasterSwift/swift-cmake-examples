# CMake Examples for Swift

This repository contains example projects demonstrating how to setup a Swift project with CMake.  Make sure to use the CMake Ninja generator and Ninja build tool. These hopefully cover a wide variety of use cases.  Patches to add examples of missing use cases are welcome.

## Projects
- Hello Minimal
  * Simple project with a pure Swift library and executable
- Build Dependencies
  * Simple project with a library that depends on an external package which is built as part of the build
- Hello World
